# CryptoClustering

CryptoClustering is a Python project that explores the clustering of cryptocurrency market data using K-Means clustering. It provides a toolset for analyzing and understanding patterns within the cryptocurrency market, helping users identify potential groupings and trends among different cryptocurrencies.

## Introduction

Cryptocurrency markets are known for their complexity and volatility. Understanding the behavior of individual cryptocurrencies and their relationships can be challenging. CryptoClustering aims to simplify this process by applying clustering techniques to cryptocurrency market data.

The project provides tools to preprocess data, perform K-Means clustering, determine the optimal number of clusters, and visualize the results. Users can gain insights into how cryptocurrencies are behaving in groups, which can inform investment decisions and market analysis.

## Features

- Data Preprocessing: Scale and reduce dimensionality using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
- K-Means Clustering: Discover clusters of cryptocurrencies based on market characteristics.
- Elbow Method: Automatically determine the optimal number of clusters.
- Data Visualization: Visualize clustering results.
